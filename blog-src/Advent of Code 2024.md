# Advent of Code 2024
Advent of Code is an advent calendar of programming puzzles. They can be solved any programming language - only the output/result matters. 

This year I am doing AoC while trying to use as many different programming languages as possible. Both as an exercise and to explore new languages. I will write up my experiences of each day (at least each day I complete) here!

As always you can find the code in this [repository](https://github.com/nailuj05/aoc24) (I will release my solutions the day after)

**Day 01 - Perl**

Using Perl here was really fun. I have never used it before. It feels like pythons older brother. 
The easy file I/O, list and hash map handling made it a great fit for this task as well. I would also like to explore Perls regex capabilities in a future task.


**Day 02 - Go**

I haven't really used go, except for a short time a few years back. Following a recommendation of a friend I wanted to try it out again. To be honest using Go on today's challenge was not a great experience, I am not sure how much of that is to blame on me though - there are a few caveats where I don't see the benefit (yet?). Slices referencing their source array instead of copying was off-putting in particular. I don't see how this isn't a big source of nasty or annoying bugs, but that might boil down to a skill issue after all.

This won't be the last time using Go, and I am looking forward to fully exploring the language and getting my hands dirty with it.
