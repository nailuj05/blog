      <h1>Advent of Code 2024</h1>Advent of Code is an advent calendar of programming puzzles. They can be solved any programming language - only the output/result matters.<br><br>This year I am doing AoC while trying to use as many different programming languages as possible. Both as an exercise and to explore new languages. I will write up my experiences of each day (at least each day I complete) here!<br><br>As always you can find the code in this <a href="https://github.com/nailuj05/aoc24">repository</a> (I will release my solutions the day after)<br><br><hr><br><b>Day 01 - Perl</b><br><br>Using Perl here was really fun. I have never used it before. It feels like pythons older brother.<br>The easy file I/O, list and hash map handling made it a great fit for this task as well. I would also like to explore Perls regex capabilities in a future task.<br><br><br><b>Day 02 - Go</b><br><br>I haven't really used go, except for a short time a few years back. Following a recommendation of a friend I wanted to try it out again. To be honest using Go on today's challenge was not a great experience, I am not sure how much of that is to blame on me though - there are a few caveats where I don't see the benefit (yet?). Slices referencing their source array instead of copying was off-putting in particular. I don't see how this isn't a big source of nasty or annoying bugs, but that might boil down to a skill issue after all.<br><br>This won't be the last time using Go, and I am looking forward to fully exploring the language and getting my hands dirty with it.<br><br>
