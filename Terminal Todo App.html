      <h1>Terminal Todo App</h1><br>I have todo lists everywhere, on my phone, on the web, on my PC, in my note-taking app etc...<br>So why not build another one? One that I actually see on a daily basis.<br>I wanted to keep this project small and simple, something that can be done in an hour. In that spirit I wanted to work in C, for persistent storage I wanted to use a database. Having never worked with databases outside of web applications, I was looking forward to getting some experience in that regard.<br><br><img src="_images/Pasted image 20241110234231.png"><br><br>I set a goal to keep it minimal, with just the basics: add, list, delete tasks, and a reset option.<br><br>The <code>todo_init</code> function sets up a database file, creating a <code>todos</code> table with <code>id</code> and <code>task</code> columns if it doesnâ€™t already exist. This ensures data persists between uses, which is critical for a lightweight task manager like this. Adding tasks is done with a parameterized SQL query for security, and each task is assigned a unique ID, making them easy to refer back to.<br><br>The program uses simple CLI commands: <code>add</code> adds a new task, <code>ls</code> lists all tasks, <code>del</code> removes a task by ID, and <code>reset</code> clears the database. Listing tasks is a quick SQL query, and deletion uses a bound parameter for the ID to prevent mistakes or injections.<br><br>In the end, this quick project turned out exactly as I hoped: a straightforward, always-visible todo list that got me comfortable with SQLite in C, all in just a few lines of code.<br><br>And that's already it, keeping it really short with this blog post, I am working on some bigger (and cooler) projects that I'll soon be able to share.<br><br>In the meantime, check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/nailuj05/todo">here</a><br>
