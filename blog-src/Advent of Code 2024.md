# Advent of Code 2024
Advent of Code is an advent calendar of programming puzzles. They can be solved any programming language - only the output/result matters. 

This year I am doing AoC while trying to use as many different programming languages as possible. Both as an exercise and to explore new languages. I will write up my experiences of each day (at least each day I complete) here!

As always you can find the code in this [repository](https://github.com/nailuj05/aoc24) (I will release my solutions the day after)

**Day 01 - Perl**

Using Perl here was really fun. I have never used it before. It feels like pythons older brother. 
The easy file I/O, list and hash map handling made it a great fit for this task as well. I would also like to explore Perls regex capabilities in a future task.
