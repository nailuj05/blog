# Advent of Code 2024

Doing AoC while trying to use as many different programming languages as possible. 
Both as an exercise and to explore new languages. 


## Day 01 - Perl

Using Perl here was really fun. I have never used it before. It feels like pythons older brother. 
The easy file I/O, list and hash map handling made it a great fit for this task as well. I would also like to explore Perls regex capabilities in a future task.
